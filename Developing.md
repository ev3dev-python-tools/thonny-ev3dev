# Developing thonny-ev3dev plugin

## Setup plugin project with multiple context projects (each a git project) 

 To develop a project we sometimes need to have several related projects also set up. 

   For example, the thonny-ev3dev plugin for thonny uses the ev3devcmd library to implement most of its
   functionality. But being a plugin for thonny, it of course also requires the Thonny package which implements the
   Thonny IDE for which this project is a plugin. In this case, the plugin depends on the IDE.
  
 The related projects can be a project your project depends on, or can be a project your project needs as a 
 dependency. Both cases are in context of your project, so therefore we call them 'context projects'.  

 When you are developing in a project, a change in the project can require also a change in a context project.
 Therefore it would be convenient as a developer that you can edit in both projects in your setup.
 
 To allow developing in the thonny-ev3dev plugin and its context
 projects we set up the thonny-ev3dev project as the main project and setup 
 the context projects within the main project. Then we can work in the main and its context projects in 
 parallel, each having its own .git folder to do commits to its own repository.
 All modern ide's recognise the .git folder of the main project and the context projects!
 So we can easily commit changes done at each git repo from the IDE also.
 
 
 Instructions to setup:

 * checkout from git the main project (thonny-ev3dev)
 
     - https://github.com/ev3dev-python-tools/thonny-ev3dev.git

 * In python we do not have project support which set ups a sandbox environment for you like in languages like Rust.
   Instead you need to create this environment for your project self with an virtual env tool.
      
               python3 -m venv .venv 
               source .venv/bin/activate

   Our project is now isolated/sandboxed. We only install the dependencies of this project in this virtual environment.
   We don't add the virtual env environment to the git project because it can become very large, and it can easy be replicated.

 * For every new bash shell we need to load this environment with:

                source .venv/bin/activate  
 
 * within the main project make a subdir context/ <br>
   we choose to have the context projects as subdirs within the main project.
   
 * add context/ to .gitignore of the main project<br>
   - NOTE: context/  shouldn't be in git project. The context projects in the context/ folder
     are installed only locally because we want to work on 
     the main and its context projects at the same time in a single project!! 
     The main project, and the context projects all have their own git project independent of each other.
                
 * within context/ checkout from git each context project:
 
    - https://github.com/thonny/thonny.git (take some specific tagged version) 
    - https://github.com/ev3dev-python-tools/ev3devcmd.git
    - https://github.com/ev3dev-python-tools/ev3dev2simulator.git
    - https://github.com/ev3dev-python-tools/ev3devrpyc.git
    - https://github.com/ev3dev-python-tools/ev3devlogging.git

   Note: we clone each subproject ourselves because that is easier and less confusing than using the submodules feature in
   git itself. 
    
 * configure context projects to be used by main project:

     1) all projects must be on same PYTHONPATH so that they are available to each other in the same python runtime.
     2) all projects dependencies must be installed     

 * there are several ways to do this, but currently the best method is using editable installs:

     + install each context project as an editable install
     + also install the main module as an editable install
     + source code of the editable install, which is local in our folder, is by using this special install
       made available on the PYTHONPATH. So all projects are available in the same python runtime! 
     + ADVANTAGE above conventional method: because an editable install also installs its dependencies
     + ADVANTAGE: this way is python's own way and is not dependent of any IDE
     + all modern IDE's support editable installs
     + note: when using the IDEA IDE do the editable install with the IDE and not with pip,
             because somehow editable installs done by pip are not picked up by the IDE. 
             vscode however works fine with editable installs done by pip.

 * We use pip-tools to automatically install all dependencies, including the editable installs, for us.
   The 'requirements.txt' file in the repository is generated by running:

              pip-compile pyproject.toml context.txt

   Where 'pyproject.toml' contains the dependencies of the project in production.  The file 'context.txt'
   contains our editable installs. For each project X it contains a line '-e ./dir/to/project/X'.

 * An editable install X in context.txt overrules a normal install X
   in pyproject.toml. The 'pip-compile' command generates a list of all dependencies of the project
   where each dependency is locked to a specific version. Using the lock file we can install the project
   with the exact same dependencies on different develop machines.  
 
 * On the first time we setup the project on a new machine we have to create a new virtual environment
   for the machine:

               python3 -m venv .venv 
               source .venv/bin/activate                   
               pip install pip-tools build
               pip-sync 

   Here 'pip-sync' automatically installs all normal and editable installs in our virtual environment.
   
 * If during development we change our project dependencies we have to run the pip-compile and pip-sync
   commands again to get the virtual environment updated with the new depencies setup. If some dependency
   is not needed anymore, then 'pip-sync' will delete it for us from the virtual environment.  


 * The repository contains a 'project.bash' script which helps you running above commands more easily:
        
        $ source project.bash
        usage: source project.bash  setup|activate
        
           setup: creates requirements.txt lock file and activates project
           activate: activates project; requires only requirements.txt
        
        note: only run setup when requirements.txt file not yet exists or you changed the project dependencies
        note: each command creates and activates automatically a new virtual environment in .venv/ if it not yet exists
